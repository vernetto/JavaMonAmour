#API Gateway
- creates RESTful APIs that enable stateless client-server communication
- creates WebSocket APIs which enables stateful, full-duplex communication between client and server

#Kinesis: real time data streaming, high-throughput, ordered, real-time data ingestion

#Kinesis Data Firehose
- load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, and Splunk 


#Kinesis Data Analytics : 
- a fully managed service that allows you to process and transform streaming data using SQL, with minimal infrastructure overhead
- can output directly to Amazon S3


#ECS
Elastic Container Service

#ECS with EC2 launch type
- you manage EC2 instances yourself 
- charged based on EC2 instances and EBS volumes used

#ECS with Fargate launch type
- you do not manage servers
- charged based on vCPU and memory resources 
- more granular and flexible in pricing, especially for sporadic or event-driven workloads.
