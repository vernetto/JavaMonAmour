Hi Marc,

 

I couple of valuable tips can be learned from this book, which actually should be taken into consideration before starting engineering frameworks around REST.

 

·         Tracking business transaction boundaries over complex REST call graphs, wrapping up diverted downstream REST calls from one user business transaction through correlation id’s, chapter tracking transactions.

·         Advanced context aware exception handling with commons lang3 contexted runtime exceptions.

·         And logging REST calls with MDC and Admin4J logging request filters.

 

All software is for free and practised widely.

 

Cheers Rob


Hi Armin,

 

Microservices for Java EE Architects: Addendum for The Java EE Architect's Handbook

 

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29988611-microservices-for-java-ee-architects

 

 

Specifically check the sections on logging and transaction tracking

 

Lot of questions get answered here that should be considered before creating that core framework, like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it

 

 

Great book

Hi Pierre,

 

Books wildfly administration and JEE development with wildfly are good start reads, I put them online, you can download these books from the net.

https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/NEXUS-10121  they provide a "component upload UI replacement" and starting to work on a UI addition https://github.com/TOPdesk/nexus3-artifact-upload ...

but the batch upload can apparently be done only with maven deploy:deploy-file . Someone prepared a Maven batch uploader https://github.com/ronbadur/maven-artifacts-uploader

today applications are made 80%-90% of reusable components

 

1 security expert for every 100-150 developers

 

using an Eclipse/Intellij Plugin with security info for each component EMPOWERS developers to be drivers of security decision

 

coding from the beginning with a safe version of a component avoid painful migrations later (110 times cheaper to fix in development than in PROD)

 

for each component you have: popularity, licence risks, security alerts

 

you can enforce the right component version by using the dependencyManagement tag in maven POM
